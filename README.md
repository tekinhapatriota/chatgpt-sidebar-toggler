# ChatGPT Sidebar Toggle Extension

Chrome extension to toggle the sidebar visibility on OpenAI's ChatGPT website, providing a cleaner interface for focused conversations.

This is a simple Google Chrome extension that adds a toggle button to show or hide the sidebar on the [OpenAI Chat website](https://chat.openai.com/). The extension works by modifying the width of the sidebar and repositioning the toggle button accordingly.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Google Chrome browser and navigate to the `chrome://extensions` page.

3. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.

4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the `sidebar-toggle-extension` folder that you cloned in step 1.

5. The extension should now appear in the list of installed extensions, and the toggle button should be visible on the target website.

## Usage

To use the extension, simply navigate to the [OpenAI Chat website](https://chat.openai.com/) and click on the toggle button (â˜°) in the top left corner of the page. The sidebar will show or hide based on its current state.

## Files
